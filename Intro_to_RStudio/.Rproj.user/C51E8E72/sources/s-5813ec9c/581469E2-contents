```

## Totals
```{r}
renderDygraph({
d %>% filter(State==input$State) -> dd
dd %>% select(c(3,7, 10:13)) ->dd

dd<- xts(dd[,2:6], order.by=dd$`End Week`)

```


## Deaths per million

```{r}
renderDygraph({
d %>% filter(State==input$State) -> dd

dd %>% select(c(3,15:16)) ->dd

dd<- xts(dd[,2:3], order.by=dd$`End Week`)

})

The data have been downloaded from

Due to the long delay in registering deaths only data up to the end of May are used.

## CDC definitions

Pneumonia deaths are identified using multiple cause-of-death codes from the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD–10): J12–J18, excluding deaths that involve influenza (J09–J11). Influenza deaths are identified from the ICD–10 codes J09–J11, and include deaths with pneumonia or COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause of death.

Coronavirus disease deaths are identified using the ICD–10 code U07.1. Deaths are coded to U07.1 when coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 are reported as a cause that **contributed** to death on the death certificate. These can include laboratory confirmed cases, **as well as cases without laboratory confirmation.** If the certifier suspects COVID-19 or determines it was likely (e.g., the circumstances were compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), they can report COVID-19 as “probable” or “presumed” on the death certificate. COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause on the death certificate in 94% of deaths.
